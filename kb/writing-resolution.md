title: "Writing a Resolution"
---

*Note: This guide assumes you've already choosen a topic; if not, see [Choosing a resolution topic](./choosing-topic-resolution.md).*

The General Assembly, the supreme law-making body of the UN, expresses its intentions and actions as a *resolution*.
In this article, we'll learn how to write one.

A resolution is composed of two parts: the *preambulatory* (or preambular) and *operative* clauses.
Preambulatory clauses provide background on why your resolution is needed, the problem it addresses, and sets the tone for the operative clauses.
Operative clauses are the items of action; they are directives that countries agree to.
(Only the Security Council has the power of passing *mandatory* directives.)
