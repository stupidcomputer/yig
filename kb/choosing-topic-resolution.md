title: "Choosing a resolution topic"
---

This is a tricky thing.
You've already picked a country, and so you have to choose a topic to write your resolution on.
Here are some things to keep in mind as you're choosing a topic.

1. Choose a *worldwide* topic.

Unless you're requesting immediate aid in the wake of a disaster, personalized solutions (ie. solutions only applicable to one country) are not the point of the UN.
Make the solutions enumerated in your resolution applicable to other countries, too.

2. Choose a *memorable* topic.

Don't do a resolution about drilling wells in Africa for water, because that's been done to death.
Try to come up with a unique way to solve the problems at hand.
One of the components which your resolutions will be scored on is originality, so keep that in mind.

3. Choose a topic with an asymmetrical *information advantage*.

What is a topic with an "asymmetrical information advantage"?
It's a topic that is common and prevalant, but not a lot of people know the intricate details of.
Like the American healthcare system, or the ICAO.
This is less important than the other ones, but is still something to consider -- choose a topic with an information advantage and it makes it easier during debate.

4. Choose an *important* topic.

This is the most important one.
Choose a relevant topic.
If you're country's in the news recently, look there for inspiration.

Got a good idea? Great. Now it's time to [write your resolution](./writing-resolution.md).
